# CarTrawler Test

For the given test, I have created a site that shows the available cars the given JSON file.
The website loads functions from the JavaScript file to show the data and bootstrap 5.0 was used to style the majority of the website.

The website has four key files:
* index.html (The main page used to display all details).
* info.html (Used to display the selected car data).
* Resources/app.js (Contains all the JavaScript functions).
* Resources/style.css (Contains the non bootstrap css).

A CDN was used for Bootstrap so it is not needed locally. Can be found [here](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css).

There are no external resources needed to view the pages locally.
