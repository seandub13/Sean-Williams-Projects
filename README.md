# Sean-Williams-Projects

### Hi,

#### I am Sean Williams, a software developer from Dublin, Ireland.

I have experience in many different languages and pride myself in my ability to pick up new languages.
The languages I work the most in are Java, JavaScript, React, Angular , python and many more.
Most of the code I write is used internally in my job so that cannot be showcased.
So instead, I have chosen some projects I have worked on in my bachelors and masterâ€™s degrees, along with simple projects I used to help understand new languages.

If you have any questions or want to reach out to me, dont be shy.
You can email me at seanwilliams712@gmail.com or connect with me on [linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-williams-834525140) .

Each folder should contain a specific readme file with information regarding that section.
