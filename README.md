# Sean-Williams-Projects

##Hi,

##I am Sean Williams, a software developer from Dublin, Ireland.
I have experiance in many different langueses and pride myself in my ability to pick up new langues.
The langues I work the most in are Java, JavaScript, React, Angular , python and many more.
Most of the code I write is used internally in my job so that can not be showcased.
So instead I have chosen some projects I have worked on in my bacherlas and masters degrees, aloung with simple projects I used to help understand new languges.

If you have any questions or want to reach out to me, dont be shy.
You can email me at seanwilliams712@gmail.com or connect with me on [linkedin!](http://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-williams-834525140) .

Each folder should contain a specific readme file with information regarding that section.
