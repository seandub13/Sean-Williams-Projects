The largest personal project I have worked on is a Virtual Reality application that provided video tours of college campuses.
This was a duo final year project where I focused on all the technology components while my parter focused on the busiess side of the project.
The application was developed using the Unity Engine to create the virtual environment and was programed using C#.
The projects file are currently too big to upload onto Github but a live demonstration of the application can be done upon request.
I have attached the final report (which I co-wrote) on the project in this folder. 
The techincal components start on page 28 were I start to describe the architecture of the applciation and the project itself.
