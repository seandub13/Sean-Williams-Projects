I created this website as an interactive way to get to know me and showcase some development skills. I have been programming for over 10 years, orignally starting out with a 300 page book that thought you how to make websites and I have been developing ever since. Over this time I have gathered experiance in multiple different programming languages such Java, Python, Angular, Javascript, C++, Haskell and many more. I studied Enterprise Computing at Dublin City Univercity graduating in 2019 with Honours Bachelor's Degree and I am in the process of obtaining my Masters from Technological University Dublin in Advanced Software Development. I joined AIG after college as part of a rotation program that allowed me to get experiance in different areas of software development so that I can now work as a full stack developer. Other then all that, some of my hobbies include teaching, basketball, esports If I had to describe my self, I think the best way to put it is that I am big nerd who loves American sports that wants to create interesting and usefull web applcations.
